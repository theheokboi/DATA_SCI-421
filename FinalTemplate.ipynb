The text should appear in markdown cells. This section will also present the software that executes the analysis, as well as any corresponding plots. Figures should have a caption (in a markdown cell). You will need multiple cells to complete this section. Units and uncertainties are important to report throughout this section (we never discussed significant figures in class, but please adhere to this in your reporting).* "
